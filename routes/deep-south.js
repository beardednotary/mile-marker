// south to the Gulf.
//
// Content module. Same schema as mile-marker-v2.html. Nothing in here touches
// the engine; see INTEGRATION at the bottom for the handful of places the
// engine assumes Route 1.
//
// Voice: the desert was absence. This is presence — too much of everything,
// and above all people, whose wanting you can't read. Sentences run longer
// and wetter, and stop short only when something is wrong.
//
// Cross-route reads use `s.carried?.x` (optional chaining) so nothing here
// throws if the carried-state key hasn't been added yet.
